TCS Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview:

This project focuses on predicting the future stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) using machine learning models. The primary goal is to analyze historical stock data, identify trends and patterns, and build predictive models to forecast future closing prices.

Two distinct machine learning approaches are explored:

Linear Regression: A foundational statistical model used as a baseline for prediction.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly suited for time-series data, capable of learning from long-term dependencies.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for data analysis, model development, and visualization.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the dataset in a DataFrame.

NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization and plotting, used to create insightful charts and graphs.

Scikit-learn: Provides tools for data preprocessing (e.g., MinMaxScaler), model training (LinearRegression), and evaluation metrics.

TensorFlow & Keras: The deep learning framework used to build and train the LSTM model.

Dataset
The project utilizes a historical stock dataset for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The dataset includes key financial metrics such as:

Date

Open

High

Low

Close

Volume

Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, with a specific focus on time-series data:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: The CSV dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. The data is then cleaned, and relevant columns are converted to the correct data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are created to understand the data's trends. This includes plotting the stock's closing price over time to observe its historical performance.

Feature Engineering: A new feature, Price_Change, is created by calculating the difference between the Close and Open prices.

Model Building & Training:

A Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to establish a baseline for prediction.

An LSTM model is built using TensorFlow/Keras. The data is reshaped into sequences (timesteps) to allow the model to learn from past data points.

Model Evaluation: The performance of both models is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score to determine their accuracy.

Prediction & Visualization: The models are used to make predictions on unseen test data, and the results are visualized against the actual values to assess model performance visually.

How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/(https://github.com/Adhi262004)/tcs-stock-prediction.git](https://github.com/[your-username](https://github.com/Adhi262004)/tcs-stock-prediction.git)
cd tcs-stock-prediction

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

Run the Notebook: Open the TCS Stock Data.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook) and run the cells sequentially.

Key Findings
The LSTM model is expected to perform significantly better than the Linear Regression model, as it is better equipped to handle the sequential nature of stock price data.

The MinMaxScaler is crucial for deep learning models like LSTM to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, which helps the model train more effectively.

Visualization is key to understanding model performance and identifying where predictions deviate from the actual stock prices.

Future Scope
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different LSTM layers, neuron counts, and epochs to optimize model performance.

Additional Features: Integrate more features like moving averages, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), or market news sentiment to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a web application or an API to allow for real-time stock price predictions.
